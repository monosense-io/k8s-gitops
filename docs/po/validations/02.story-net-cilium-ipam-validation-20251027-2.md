# PO Validation — STORY-NET-CILIUM-IPAM (2025-10-27, pass 2)

- Story file: `docs/stories/STORY-NET-CILIUM-IPAM.md`
- Architecture refs: `docs/architecture.md` (Networking/Cilium; Repository Layout), `docs/IP-ALLOCATION-SUMMARY.md`
- QA refs: `docs/qa/assessments/02.story-net-cilium-ipam-risk-20251027.md`, `docs/qa/assessments/02.story-net-cilium-ipam-test-design-20251027.md`

## Template Compliance

- Sections present per template: Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks / Subtasks, Dev Notes (with Testing), Dev Agent Record, QA Results, Change Log — present.
- Placeholders: None detected (`{{…}}`, `_TBD_`, `TBD`, or unsubstituted `${…}` in narrative).
- Structure: Story includes additional sections (Why/Outcome, Scope, Architecture Decision, Validation Steps, DoD); acceptable for this repo. Ordering is consistent and readable.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

- None. Previous blockers resolved:
  - Removed reliance on `spec.disabled` and `metadata.namespace` in `CiliumLoadBalancerIPPool` examples.
  - Fixed Flux build commands (`flux build -f kubernetes/clusters/{infra,apps}/infrastructure.yaml --path .`).
  - Defined per‑cluster inclusion pattern and cluster‑level `Kustomization` (cilium‑ipam) with `dependsOn: cilium-core`.
  - Added required template sections and linked QA artifacts.

## Should‑Fix (Quality)

- Consider adding a tiny AC↔Files table for quick verification (paths for infra/apps pool files and component kustomizations).
- Optionally include a short “Example cluster Kustomization snippet” block for `cilium-ipam` mirroring Story 01 style, to ease dev copy‑paste.

## Nice‑to‑Have

- Add `scripts/validate-cilium-ipam.sh` to automate the checks enumerated in T5 and the QA test design.
- In DoD, explicitly state that cluster Kustomization YAMLs have been appended to both cluster files (infra/apps) with `dependsOn` set.

## Anti‑Hallucination

- IP ranges and assignments align with `docs/IP-ALLOCATION-SUMMARY.md` and cluster‑settings files. OK.
- CRD assumptions made portable by avoiding non‑portable fields; per‑cluster inclusion pattern is source‑verified in repo.

## Final Assessment

- Decision: GO (ready for implementation)
- Implementation Readiness Score: 9/10
- Confidence: High

## PO Sign‑off Notes

- Dev agent should scaffold component files and add the `cilium-ipam` cluster Kustomizations as first task, then run local validations per T5 and QA test design.
