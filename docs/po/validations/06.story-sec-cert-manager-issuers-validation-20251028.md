# Story Draft Validation â€” STORY-SEC-CERT-MANAGER-ISSUERS (2025-10-28)

Story: docs/stories/STORY-SEC-CERT-MANAGER-ISSUERS.md
Validator: Product Owner (PO)

## Template Compliance Issues

- All required sections present: Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks / Subtasks, Dev Notes (with Testing), Change Log, Dev Agent Record, QA Results.
- No template placeholders found. Note: Prometheus `{{ $labels.* }}` expressions are intentional.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

- None. Prior issues resolved (added missing sections, AC mapping, Dev Notes, QA references).

## Should-Fix Issues

- Verify repo wiring target: `kubernetes/infrastructure/security/kustomization.yaml` may not exist yet in this repo state. If absent, Dev should create it (not just update) and include `external-secrets/ks.yaml` (from Story 05) and `cert-manager/ks.yaml` (this story).
- Confirm `dependsOn` target name `external-secrets` matches the actual Kustomization name used by Story 05 once merged.

## Nice-to-Have Improvements

- Add a short note in Dev Notes that PrometheusRule requires the prometheus-operator CRDs (installed in Phase 0) to avoid apply-time errors; reference PRD if useful.

## Anti-Hallucination Findings

- All technical claims trace back to PRD/Architecture. No invented APIs.

## Final Assessment

- GO: Story is ready for implementation.
- Implementation Readiness Score: 9/10
- Confidence Level: High
