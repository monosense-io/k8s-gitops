# PO Validation (Re-run) — STORY-NET-CILIUM-CORE-GITOPS — 2025-10-27

- Story: `docs/stories/STORY-NET-CILIUM-CORE-GITOPS.md`
- Changes since prior validation (2025-10-27): critical items resolved; should-fix and nice-to-haves implemented.

## Template Compliance

- Sections present and ordered: Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks/Subtasks (4 Phases), Dev Notes (Testing), Dev Agent Record, Change Log, QA Results. OK.
- Placeholders: None found.
- Heading consistency: “Tasks / Subtasks — Implementation Plan (4 Phases)”. OK.
- Links: Architecture link updated to §10 Networking (Cilium). OK.

## Critical Issues (from prior report) — Status

- AC-2 scope drift (Gateway/BGP in core) → FIXED. AC-5 now “Core Only”.
- Substitution ownership wording → FIXED. Clarified at AC-3 and tasks: owned by cluster Kustomizations.
- KubePrism mismatch (127.0.0.1:7445) → FIXED. Replaced with cluster API host; validation script now checks against cluster-settings.

## Should-Fix Items — Status

- Flux build vs kustomize distinction → FIXED (Troubleshooting clarified).
- Schema validation scope note → FIXED (kubeconform note added).
- Phase labeling and stale references → FIXED (risk table rows updated to Phase 3/Story 45).
- AC↔Files checklist + Phase↔AC map → ADDED.

## Nice-to-Have — Status

- Taskfile suggestion for local validation → ADDED as suggestion.
- Gate integration → ADDED as AC-8 and Phase 3 checklist; QA Results now include paste-ready blocks.

## New Observations

- QA Results contain both the original 15-scenario test_design and the updated 18-scenario block. Recommend keeping only the latest (18) to avoid confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage

- AC-1..AC-8 are clear, testable, and map to tasks. OK.
- AC-4 now asserts zero `${VAR}` in flux build (both clusters). OK.
- AC-8 requires gate file prep using provided YAML blocks. OK.

## Anti‑Hallucination

- All technical claims trace to architecture or repo structure. No invented details detected.

## Final Assessment

- Decision: GO (ready for implementation)
- Implementation Readiness Score: 9/10
- Confidence: High

### Minor tidy-up before merge (optional)
- In QA Results, remove the older test_design summary (15 scenarios) to keep only the latest 18-scenario block.
