## Cilium Bootstrap Fix

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Cilium bootstrap architecture fix and analysis.

### Documentation Files

#### 1. **BOOTSTRAP_ANALYSIS.md** - Reference Pattern Research
- Comparison of bootstrap patterns from buroa and onedrop implementations
- Current k8s-gitops implementation review
- Identified gaps and architectural issues
- Recommendations for alignment
- Pattern compliance matrix

**Read this first** to understand how reference implementations bootstrap their clusters.

#### 2. **ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md** - Technical Deep Dive
- Detailed explanation of the dual Cilium management conflict
- Code evidence of the problem
- Cascade failure chain visualization
- Step-by-step fix implementation
- Architecture before/after comparison

**Read this next** to understand the root cause and why it causes failures.

#### 3. **FIX_VALIDATION.md** - Testing & Validation Procedures
- Pre-fix and post-fix validation checklists
- Step-by-step verification procedures
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Expected convergence timeline
- Permanent fix verification steps

**Use this** to validate the fix is working correctly after deployment.

#### 4. **CILIUM_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - Executive Summary
- Problem statement and impact assessment
- Solution overview with before/after comparison

## The Issue in One Paragraph

Cilium was being managed by **two conflicting controllers**: (1) bootstrap helmfile which deployed it one-time during initialization, and (2) Flux HelmRelease which tried to continuously manage it. This dual management caused HelmRelease to get stuck in UpgradeFailed state, leaving Cilium pods unable to start (0/3 ready), which cascaded into failure for all 15+ dependent infrastructure components.

## The Fix in One Paragraph

Removed the conflicting Flux HelmRelease for Cilium, keeping only bootstrap helmfile deployment. Flux now manages only day-2 features (BGP policies, ClusterMesh, Gateway API, IPAM) that depend on Cilium already being ready. This separates concerns, prevents conflicts, and aligns with battle-tested patterns from buroa and onedrop implementations.

## Key Files Modified

- **Deleted**: `kubernetes/bases/cilium/` (contained conflicting HelmRelease)
- **Modified**: `kubernetes/infrastructure/networking/cilium/kustomization.yaml` (removed HelmRelease reference)
- **Modified**: `kubernetes/infrastructure/networking/cilium/ks.yaml` (removed health checks for bootstrap-managed resources)

## Architecture Principles

**✓ Bootstrap Phase (One-Time)**
- CRD extraction (00-crds.yaml)
- Core services deployment (01-core.yaml):
  - Cilium CNI
  - CoreDNS
  - cert-manager
  - external-secrets
  - flux-operator
  - flux-instance

**✓ Flux Phase (Continuous)**
- Day-2 features that depend on bootstrap services
- Infrastructure and workload management
- Continuous GitOps reconciliation

**✗ Never Do**
- Manage bootstrap services with Flux (chicken-egg problem)
- Dual management of same resource
- Unclear separation of concerns
