## Addendum ‚Äî DNS, ExternalDNS, and Cloudflare Tunnel (Recorded 2025-10-22)

This addendum records research and the selected pattern as of 2025-10-22 without altering the original 2025-10-21 snapshot:

- Two ExternalDNS controllers: Cloudflare for public zone under `SECRET_DOMAIN`; RFC2136 to BIND for private LAN zone.
- Cloudflared named tunnel with ‚â•2 replicas, QUIC transport, readiness/metrics endpoints, and minimal wildcard ingress.
- One-time Cloudflare DNS anchor `external.${SECRET_DOMAIN}` CNAME to `<TUNNEL-UUID>.cfargotunnel.com` (proxied). Per-app hostnames are CNAMEs to this anchor via ExternalDNS and Gateway annotations.
- TXT registry with distinct owner IDs and optional `--txt-prefix=k8s.` to prevent record contention across controllers.

Implementation details are maintained in the live document at docs/architecture.md ¬ß23.
