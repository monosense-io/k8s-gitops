## Purpose

This document provides detailed guidelines for classifying and handling backup data according to regulatory requirements and security best practices.

## Classification Matrix

### Data Classification Framework

| Classification | Definition | Examples | Regulatory Impact |
|----------------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| **CONFIDENTIAL** | Data requiring highest protection due to regulatory or business impact | Personal data, financial records, health information, payment data | GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOX |
| **INTERNAL** | Data for internal use that would cause moderate impact if disclosed | Application configs, system logs, performance metrics | Internal policies |
| **PUBLIC** | Data intended for public disclosure | Documentation, marketing content | None |
