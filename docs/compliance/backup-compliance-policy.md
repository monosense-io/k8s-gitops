   - System logs
   - Performance metrics
   - Internal documentation

3. **PUBLIC (Low Risk)**
   - Public documentation
   - Marketing materials
   - Public content

### Retention Periods

| Data Type | Retention Period | Storage Tier | Compliance Framework |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Personal Data | 2-7 years | Hot → Cold | GDPR |
| Financial Data | 7 years | Hot → Cold | SOX |
| Health Data | 7+ years | Hot → Cold | HIPAA |
| Payment Data | As required | Hot → Cold | PCI-DSS |
| System Configs | 1-3 years | Hot → Warm | Internal |
| Audit Logs | 7 years | Immutable | All |

## Backup Architecture

### Multi-Tier Storage

**Hot Storage (0-90 days)**
- High-performance SSD storage
- Immediate recovery capability
- RTO: < 1 hour
- RPO: < 15 minutes

**Warm Storage (90 days - 1 year)**
- Standard performance storage
- Recovery within 4-24 hours
- Cost-optimized for medium-term retention

**Cold Storage (1-7 years)**
- Archive-grade storage
- Recovery within 48-72 hours
- Compliant with long-term retention requirements

### Backup Components

1. **Cluster Backups**
   - Tool: Velero with compliance plugins
   - Frequency: Daily incremental, Weekly full
   - Scope: Kubernetes manifests, configurations, secrets

2. **Database Backups**
   - Tool: CloudNative-PG with BarmanObjectStore
   - Frequency: Every 4 hours for critical databases
   - Scope: PostgreSQL databases, transaction logs

3. **Persistent Volume Backups**
   - Tool: Rook-Ceph snapshots + Velero
   - Frequency: Daily
   - Scope: Application data, user content

4. **Configuration Backups**
   - Tool: GitOps repository backup
   - Frequency: On change
   - Scope: All infrastructure as code
