# Sprint Change Proposal — STORY-DB-CNPG-OPERATOR (2025-10-21)

Author: PO (Sarah)
Status: Draft → For Review
Scope: Correct-course edits to strengthen ACs, tasks, and self-containment

## Analysis Summary
- Trigger: PO validation found gaps in ACs (HA, PSA, PodMonitor, version alignment, watch scope) and missing template sections.
- Impact: Without these, dev handoff risks ambiguity, and validation may not ensure operator hardening.
- Path Forward: Harden ACs, make file-level tasks explicit, and add Dev Notes/Testing sections.

## Proposed Edits (Applied)
- Story: docs/stories/STORY-DB-CNPG-OPERATOR.md
  - Strengthened Acceptance Criteria (HA/PDB, PSA restricted, PodMonitor, version alignment, watch scope).
  - Added explicit Tasks referencing exact files/values to change.
  - Expanded Validation Steps with concrete kubectl checks.
  - Added Dev Notes, Testing, Change Log, Dev Agent Record, QA Results sections.
  - Updated Links to include precise repo paths and architecture Appendix B.3.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Version skew during alignment → Pin CRDs and operator chart to the same minor; stage in infra first.
- PSA change could block pods if misconfigured → Validate in branch and confirm readiness before merge.

## Approval
- PO: Pending
- SM: Pending
- Architect: Optional review

Once approved, proceed with implementation per the updated story.
