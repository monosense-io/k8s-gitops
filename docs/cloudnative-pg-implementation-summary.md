## 🔒 Security Enhancements

### Authentication & Authorization

| User Type | Purpose | Privileges | Rotation |
|-----------|---------|------------|----------|
| postgres (superuser) | CNPG operator only | Full | 90 days |
| {app}_app (gitlab, harbor, etc.) | Application access | Database-specific | 90 days |
| readonly_user | Analytics/reporting | SELECT only | 90 days |

### Encryption

- **In-Transit**: TLS 1.3 (cert-manager integration)
- **At-Rest**: Storage-level encryption (Rook-Ceph/OpenEBS)
- **Backups**: AES-256 encryption

### Network Security

- **Baseline**: Deny-all network policy
- **Allow**: DNS, internal replication, app-specific access
- **Cross-Cluster**: Cilium ClusterMesh with global services

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### Connection Pooling Impact

**Without PgBouncer:**
- 200 connections * 10MB/conn = 2GB memory overhead per instance
- 3 instances = 6GB total

**With PgBouncer:**
- Frontend: 1000 connections
- Backend: 25-50 connections per database
- Memory: 750MB pooler overhead
- **Savings: 5.25GB (87% reduction)**

### Query Performance Tuning

- **Parallel Query Workers**: 8 workers, 4 per gather
- **Work Memory**: 64MB (supports ~60 concurrent operations)
- **Maintenance Work Memory**: 1GB (faster VACUUM, CREATE INDEX)
- **Effective I/O Concurrency**: 200 (NVMe optimization)

### Storage Performance

- **Data**: OpenEBS local NVMe (~100k IOPS)
- **WAL**: Separate volume (can be moved to Rook-Ceph for replication)
- **WAL Compression**: Enabled (reduces WAL size by 30-50%)
- **Checkpoint Optimization**: 15min timeout, 0.9 completion target

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collection

- **PodMonitors**: PostgreSQL instances, PgBouncer poolers, CNPG operator
- **Custom Queries**: 7 query families (database size, bloat, connections, cache hit ratio, etc.)

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Multi-Tenant Shared Cluster

**Decision:** Use single shared-postgres cluster for multiple applications

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Resource efficiency (shared storage, memory, compute)
- ✅ Simplified management (one cluster to monitor)
- ✅ Cost optimization (single backup infrastructure)
- ⚠️ Risk: Noisy neighbor issues (mitigated by connection pooling)

**Alternative Considered:** Cluster-per-application (rejected due to overhead)

### 2. PostgreSQL 16.8 vs 15

**Decision:** Upgrade to PostgreSQL 16.8

**Rationale:**
- ✅ 20-30% performance improvements (parallel query, btree optimizations)
- ✅ Better monitoring (pg_stat_io, improved pg_stat_statements)
- ✅ Logical replication improvements (easier migration)
- ✅ Long-term support (15 EOL Nov 2027, 16 EOL Nov 2028)

### 3. PgBouncer Transaction Mode vs Session Mode

**Decision:** Transaction mode by default, session mode for Keycloak

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Transaction mode: Better connection reuse, higher efficiency
- ✅ Keycloak requires session mode (prepared statements)
- ✅ Per-application pooler allows mode selection

### 4. Storage: OpenEBS Local NVMe

**Decision:** Continue using OpenEBS local NVMe for data, consider Rook-Ceph for WAL

**Rationale:**
- ✅ NVMe provides highest IOPS (100k+)
- ✅ Local storage = lowest latency
- ⚠️ Risk: Node failure requires restore (mitigated by replication + backups)
- 📋 Future: Move WAL to Rook-Ceph for additional redundancy

### 5. Backup Retention: 30 days

**Decision:** 30-day retention on MinIO, 90-day on R2 (future)

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Compliance: Meets typical retention requirements
- ✅ Cost: Balances storage cost vs recovery capability
- ✅ PITR: Covers common recovery scenarios
