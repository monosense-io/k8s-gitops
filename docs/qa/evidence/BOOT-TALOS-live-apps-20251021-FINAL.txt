# STORY-BOOT-TALOS Phase -1 Evidence - apps cluster (FINAL)
# Date: 2025-10-21 09:16:00 UTC
# Cluster: apps
# Test Type: Phase -1 Talos Bootstrap ONLY

## Summary
Phase -1 (Talos Bootstrap) COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY:
- ✅ Config applied to all 3 control plane nodes  
- ✅ Bootstrap executed successfully on apps-01
- ✅ etcd cluster healthy with 3 voting members
- ✅ Kubeconfig generated
- ✅ Kubernetes API responding
- ✅ All 3 nodes joined Kubernetes successfully

## Important Notes
- apps-03 initially joined as etcd LEARNER after manual reset/rejoin
- Auto-promoted to voting member after ~5 minutes of raft log catch-up
- Final state: All 3 members are voting members with no learners

## Talos Version
```
# All nodes running Talos v1.11.2
```

## Kubernetes API Reachability

```
$ kubectl --context=apps cluster-info
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://apps-k8s.monosense.io:6443

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
```

✅ API-001: Kubernetes API is reachable via context 'apps'

✅ ETCD-001: All 3 etcd members are voting members (LEARNER=false)

## Kubernetes Nodes
```
NAME      STATUS     ROLES           AGE   VERSION
apps-01   NotReady   control-plane   42m   v1.34.1
apps-02   NotReady   control-plane   42m   v1.34.1
apps-03   NotReady   control-plane   42m   v1.34.1
```

Note: NotReady is EXPECTED - no CNI installed yet (Phase 0 will install Cilium)

## Health Checks Performed
- ✅ etcd member list (3 voting members)
- ✅ Time synchronization (all nodes <10ms skew)
- ✅ Disk space on /var/lib/etcd (~130 MB used)
- ✅ Filesystem mounts verified
- ✅ Raft consensus (all nodes at same index)

## Test Execution
Test executed via: `task cluster:create-apps --yes`

Layer 1 (Talos Bootstrap) steps:
1. ✅ Step 1: Apply config to all 3 nodes
2. ✅ Step 2: Verify API availability
3. ✅ Step 3: Bootstrap etcd on apps-01
4. ✅ Step 4: Wait for etcd cluster formation
5. ✅ Step 5: Verify control plane health
6. ✅ Step 6: Generate kubeconfig
7. ✅ Step 7: Verify all nodes joined Kubernetes

## Known Issues Resolved
- apps-03 required manual reset to maintenance mode after stuck shutdown
- After rejoining, apps-03 was LEARNER for ~5 minutes before auto-promoting
- Final state: All 3 members are voting members

## Next Steps
Ready for Phase 0 (Prerequisites - install CRDs and core operators)
