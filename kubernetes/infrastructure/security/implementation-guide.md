## Configuration and Customization

### Customizing Security Metrics

Edit the recording rules in `advanced-security-metrics.yaml` to match your specific requirements:

```yaml
# Example: Add custom metric for application-specific security events
- record: security:app:failed_authentication_rate
  expr: |
    sum(rate(app_authentication_failures_total[5m])) by (app, namespace)
  labels:
    component: application_security
    severity: warning
```

### Configuring Alert Thresholds

Adjust alert thresholds in `security-alerting-enhancements.yaml` based on your environment:

```yaml
# Example: Adjust brute force detection threshold
- alert: BruteForceAttackDetected
  expr: |
    sum(rate(kubelet_server_authentication_errors_total[5m])) by (source_ip) > 5  # Reduced from 10
  for: 2m
```

### Customizing Compliance Frameworks

Add or modify compliance requirements in `compliance-monitoring.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example: Add custom compliance check
- record: compliance:custom:security_policy_enforced
  expr: |
    sum(kubernetes_networkpolicy_count{policy_type="custom"}) > 0
  labels:
    custom_requirement: "CORP-SEC-001"
    severity: "high"
```
