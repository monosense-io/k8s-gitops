kind: Kustomization
# Note: repositories is handled separately by flux-repositories Kustomization
# Note: storage is cluster-specific (deployed by infra only, via cluster infrastructure.yaml)
# Note: cilium is deployed via bootstrap helmfile (not via Flux), day-2 features deployed here
resources:
  # - networking  # Day 2 - Cilium/CoreDNS/Spegel already deployed via Helmfile
  - security  # ClusterSecretStore (external-secrets only, RBAC/cert-manager disabled)
  # - storage  # Cluster-specific via infrastructure/storage/ks.yaml (infra cluster only)
  # - databases  # Day 2 - CloudNativePG
  # Cilium day-2 features (cilium core deployed via bootstrap helmfile):
  - networking/cilium/ks.yaml               # Cilium day-2 kustomization (depends on cilium from bootstrap)
  - networking/cilium/clustermesh/ks.yaml   # Manage clustermesh secret via ExternalSecrets
  - networking/cilium/bgp/ks.yaml           # Own BGP peering policy via Flux
  - networking/cilium/gateway/ks.yaml       # Cilium Gateway API (using Cilium's native implementation)
  # Flux GitOps (depends on cilium for Gateway API CRDs):
  - gitops/ks.yaml                          # Flux operator + instance (HTTPRoute requires Gateway API CRDs)
